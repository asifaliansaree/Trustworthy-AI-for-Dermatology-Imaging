# Trustworthy AI for Dermatology Imaging

This repository documents the development of a trustworthy, explainable AI pipeline for dermatology image analysis, built during a research internship at the TUKL Deep Learning Lab, NUST.

## Project Goal

Build a rigorous, reproducible skin-lesion classifier on HAM10000, then apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques (Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, occlusion) to audit whether the model attends to the lesion — or to spurious image artifacts. The end goal is a short research paper targeting a medical imaging workshop (MICCAI / IEEE BHI).

* Class imbalance analysis and demographic interpretation

---

## Day 2: Lesion-wise Dataset Split & Augmented DataLoader

* Performed duplicate lesion analysis using `lesion_id` — identified lesions with multiple images
* Implemented a **lesion-wise stratified split** (80% train / 10% val / 10% test, `random_state=42`) to prevent data leakage
* Saved the split permanently as `HAM10000_split.csv` — never regenerated, always loaded
* Updated `HAM10000Dataset` to accept a `split` argument and load from the CSV
* Implemented separate augmentation pipelines:
  * **Train**: RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomVerticalFlip, ColorJitter, RandomRotation
  * **Val / Test**: Resize + Normalize only
* Applied ImageNet normalization (`mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, `std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`)
* Verified zero lesion overlap across splits with assertion checks
* Computed and saved `class_weights.npy` for class-imbalance-aware training

### Key Concepts Learned

* Stratified splitting, augmentation pipelines, class weight computation

---

## Day 3: Metadata Analysis & Integration Research

* Built `MetadataEncoder` converting age, sex, and localization into an **18-dimensional normalized feature vector**
  * Age: z-score normalized, per-class median imputation for 57 missing values, binary missing indicator
  * Sex: binary encoded (male=1, female=0, unknown=0.5)
  * Localization: one-hot encoded across 15 anatomical categories
* Added a metadata statistics section to `EDA.ipynb` — per-class age distributions, sex ratios, top localizations
* Researched and ranked three metadata integration techniques in `notes/metadata_research.md`:
  1. **Late fusion** (selected for this week) — concatenate image + metadata features before classifier head
  2. **FiLM conditioning** (planned Week 4 ablation) — modulate feature maps with metadata scale/shift
  3. **Multi-task learning** (logged as future work) — auxiliary supervision on metadata targets
* Rationale: late fusion is low-effort, directly compatible with the existing DermaNet design, and produces a clean ablation comparison for the paper

### Key Concepts Learned
* Feature normalization (z-score), one-hot encoding, missing value imputation
* Target leakage through engineered features
* Late fusion vs. FiLM conditioning vs. multi-task learning
* Effort-vs-gain prioritization in ML research planning

---

## Day 4: End-to-End Training Pipeline

* Built **DermaNet** (`src/model.py`): ResNet-18 backbone (ImageNet pretrained) with an optional metadata late-fusion head, switchable via a single `metadata_dim` config value
  * Image-only: `metadata_dim=0` → 512-d → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(7)
  * Metadata fusion: `metadata_dim=18` → 530-d → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(7)
* Implemented the full training loop (`src/train.py`):
  * Optimizer: AdamW (`lr=1e-4`, `weight_decay=1e-4`)
  * Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR (T_max=20, eta_min=1e-6)
  * Loss: CrossEntropyLoss with precomputed class weights
  * Checkpointing: saves best model by `val_balanced_accuracy` (not val_loss)
  * Logging: epoch-level CSV log (`training_log.csv`) — no external tools required
* Implemented `src/evaluate.py` and `src/evaluate_test.py`:
  * Balanced accuracy (mean per-class recall)
  * Per-class F1-score
  * Normalized confusion matrix
  * Macro ROC-AUC (one-vs-rest)
* All hyperparameters centralized in `configs/baseline.yaml` — zero magic numbers in code
* Verified end-to-end with a 1-epoch dry run in both image-only and metadata-fusion modes — no crashes, correct tensor shapes

### Key Concepts Learned
* Transfer learning with a pretrained CNN backbone
* Class-weighted loss for imbalanced multi-class classification
* Why balanced accuracy is the correct metric for HAM10000
* Config-driven, reproducible experiment design
* Saving checkpoints by the metric that matters, not the loss

---

## Day 5: Repository Polish & Leakage Re-Verification

* Re-ran lesion leakage assertion check — confirmed 0 shared `lesion_id` values across all splits
* Pinned all dependency versions in `requirements.txt`
* Documented Week 2 design decisions and rationale in `notes/week2.md`
* Updated repository structure and README

### Key Concepts Learned
* Reproducibility through pinned dependencies
* Documenting design decisions for future reference and supervisor communication

---

# Week 3

## Day 1: Full Baseline Training Run

> **Synopsis checkpoint**: *"Have a working model by end of week 3 before you specialise."*

* Launched full 20-epoch training run with `configs/baseline.yaml` (image-only mode)
* Training configuration:
  * Architecture: ResNet-18 (ImageNet pretrained)
  * Epochs: 20, Batch size: 32, LR: 1e-4 (cosine decay to 1e-6)
  * Loss: CrossEntropyLoss with class weights
  * Split: lesion-wise 80/10/10, `random_state=42`
* Best checkpoint saved at **epoch 15** with `val_balanced_accuracy = 0.7964`
* Training loss decreased consistently from 1.2297 → 0.2238 across 20 epochs

### Key Concepts Learned
* Full training loop execution on a real medical imaging dataset
* Monitoring val_balanced_accuracy as the primary training signal (not val_loss)
* CosineAnnealingLR behaviour across 20 epochs

---

## Day 2: Test-Set Evaluation & Publication Figures

* Evaluated the best checkpoint (epoch 15) on the **held-out test set for the first time**
* Computed all four paper metrics using `src/evaluate_test.py`:
  * Test balanced accuracy: **0.7318** — exceeds the 0.65 go/no-go threshold
  * Test macro F1: **0.6869**
  * Test macro ROC-AUC: **0.9478** — strong probability ranking across all 7 classes
* Generated 3 publication-quality figures (300 DPI) saved to `results/figures/`:
  * `confusion_matrix.png` — normalized, reveals mel→nv as the most frequent error
  * `per_class_f1.png` — color-coded by performance tier (red / blue / green)
  * `training_curves.png` — dual-axis with best epoch annotated
* Reconstructed `training_log.csv` from terminal output and fixed `train.py` to write CSV logs automatically on every future run
* All results locked in `results/baseline_image_only.json` — test set not to be re-evaluated

### Key Concepts Learned
* Why the test set is touched exactly once, after all design decisions are final
* Interpreting confusion matrices for clinical safety (mel→nv misclassification)
* Publication-quality figure generation with Matplotlib at 300 DPI

---

## Day 3: Metadata Fusion Ablation

* Trained a second DermaNet variant with **late fusion of 18-dimensional patient metadata** (age, sex, anatomical localization) using `configs/metadata_fusion.yaml`
  * Same architecture, optimizer, scheduler, and epochs as the baseline — only `metadata_dim=18` differs
  * Best checkpoint saved at **epoch 13** with `val_balanced_accuracy = 0.7825`
* Evaluated the fusion checkpoint on the held-out test set:
  * Test balanced accuracy: **0.7168**
  * Test macro F1: **0.6703**
  * Test macro ROC-AUC: **0.9549** — higher than image-only baseline (+0.7 pp)
* Generated ablation comparison figures:
  * `results/figures/ablation_comparison.png` — grouped bar chart of all three metrics
  * `results/figures/ablation_per_class_f1.png` — per-class F1 side-by-side for both experiments
* Fixed `evaluate_test.py` to auto-name output JSON from `experiment_name` in config — prevents result files overwriting each other
* Key finding: metadata fusion improved AUC and benefited 5 of 7 classes (bkl +11.9 pp, mel +2.4 pp) but hurt the dermatofibroma class (−30.3 pp on only 9 test samples), dragging macro averages below baseline — a rare-class noise effect, not a model failure

### Key Concepts Learned
* Controlled ablation design — changing exactly one variable between experiments
* Why a negative result is still a valid and publishable paper finding
* Rare-class instability: when test sets are too small, per-class metrics are unreliable
* Auto-naming experiment outputs from config to prevent file collisions

# Baseline Results — Table 1

| Experiment | Bal acc | Macro F1 | Macro AUC | Best val epoch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image-only (ResNet-18) | **0.7318** | **0.6869** | 0.9478 | 15 (0.7964) | Week 3 Day 2 |
| Image + metadata (late fusion) | 0.7168 | 0.6703 | **0.9549** | 13 (0.7825) | Week 3 Day 3 |

### Per-class F1 breakdown

| Class | Image-only | + Metadata | Delta | Support |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|---------|
| akiec | 0.6667 | 0.6824 | +0.0157 | 41 |
| bcc | 0.6863 | 0.6916 | +0.0053 | 44 |
| bkl | 0.5340 | 0.6531 | **+0.1191** | 113 |
| df | 0.5882 | 0.2857 | −0.3025 | 9 |
| mel | 0.5423 | 0.5662 | +0.0239 | 112 |
| nv | 0.8878 | 0.9038 | +0.0160 | 655 |
| vasc | 0.9032 | 0.9091 | +0.0059 | 15 |

> The df drop (−30 pp) is driven by only 9 test samples — a dataset size artefact, not a model failure. Metadata fusion improves ranking quality (AUC +0.7 pp) and benefits 6 of 7 classes when df is excluded.
